I graduated from Tufts in 2015 with a dual MS in Computer Science and
Mathematics. I now live in Boston, MA and work at Google. I use this website to
host blog posts on ideas I had and a handful of javascript tools I made.

 - Juggling Tools
   - [juggle-suggest2](https://joshmermelstein.com/juggle-suggest2/):
     Autocompletion as you type for valid async and sync siteswaps.
   - [3hand](https://joshmermelstein.com/3hand/): Translates vanilla siteswaps
     into passing notation so that they can be done by 3 hands. Support
     arbitrary hand orders
   - [random-siteswap](http://joshmermelstein.com/random-siteswap/): very
     random siteswaps using the cards model.
   - [polyrhythmic-fountain](https://joshmermelstein.com/polyrhythmic-fountain/):
     animates a 4 ball fountain with various polyrhythms (or with a lack of
     rhythm alltogether).
 - I also do IRL juggling sometimes
   - [My IJA tricks of the Month](https://www.juggle.org/ija-tricks-of-the-month-by-josh-mermelstein-from-usa-juggling-balls/)
   - [My Instagram where I post new ideas](https://www.instagram.com/joshmermel/)
 - Outside of juggling, I'm also very interested in twisty puzzles. At some
   point I may write up some of my solutions for my blog.
