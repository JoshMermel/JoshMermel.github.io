I graduated from Tufts in 2015 with a dual MS in Computer Science and
Mathematics. I now live in Boston, MA and work at Google. I use this website to
host blog posts on ideas I had and a handful of javascript tools I made.

   - [My Instagram where I post new ideas](https://www.instagram.com/joshmermel/)
 - Outside of juggling, I'm also very interested in twisty puzzles. At some
   point I may write up some of my solutions for my blog.
