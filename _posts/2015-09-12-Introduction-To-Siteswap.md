## Lack of Intro
Siteswap, the mathematical notation for juggling is relatively well researched
and well understood. Rather than start this blog post with a few paragraphs
about its history and some simple examples, I'm going to provide some links that
do that and jump right into the meat.

 - [A comprehensive wiki article](http://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Siteswap)
 - [A well written paper proving some fundamental results](http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~ronspubs/94_01_juggling.pdf)
 - [A more modern book proving additional theorems](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387955135?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=od_aui_detailpages00)

## Validation of Vanilla Siteswaps
It is well known that a vanilla siteswap which does not average to an integer is
invalid. What is less well known is why certain vanilla siteswaps that average
to an integer are invalid.

## Generating New Siteswaps From Existing Ones

### Add 1 to Every Number

### Add Pattern Length to One Number

### Swap Sites of Two Numbers

### Extending to Multiplex Siteswaps

### Extending to Sync Siteswaps

## Understanding Transitions

### Entry + Exit is a Valid Siteswap

### Computing Transitions Between Vanilla Siteswap
