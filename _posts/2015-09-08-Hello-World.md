The most satisfying thing to me is encountering new and exciting ideas. The
second most exciting thing to me is sharing ideas with people and having them
be excited about the new and exciting thing I've shown them. Whenever I clean
out my rss feed, I find myself sending dozens of links out to friends of mine
that I think will care.

This blog exists as a continuation of that practice. I plan to write about
things I encounter that excite me. It will probably focus mostly on technology
and math but I have a bunch of other hobbies that may sneak in too.

I hope that the reader gets as much joy from reading my ideas as I first got
when I encountered them.
