title: Animating 3 handed juggling
---

tl;dr, I made a program for translating vanilla siteswaps into animations of how
a 3-handed person might juggle them. You can play with it
[here](https://joshmermelstein.com/3hand). If you are interested in the source
code, it's available on 
[my github](https://github.com/JoshMermel/3hand/tree/gh-pages).

Background
==========

Last January, [Michael Karas](https://www.instagram.com/nycjuggler)
approached me with an idea:

"Iâ€™m interested in having a 3 handed juggling simulator created where the hands
are labeled L, M, and R. The default throwing sequence would be L, M, R, M. So
if all 3 hands are juggling 2 in 1 hand, the siteswap would be '84'"

I'm a big fan of Michael's juggling and I love to geek out about siteswap so I
was naturally excited about the project.

Jugglinglab
===========

I wrote a custom juggling animator in javascript for
[juggle-suggest2](https://joshmermelstein.com/juggle-suggest2), but modifying it
to support a third hand would have taken me weeks of work. Instead, I decided it
would be easier to write a translator to take vanilla siteswap and output links
to [the jugglinglab gif server](http://jugglinglab.org/anim).

To learn more about how jugglinglab handles several jugglers, I reached out to
[Dominik Braun](https://www.instagram.com/omnikrabundi/), author of the amazing
[Fun with Juggling Lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQaVylbJTHk) series.
Dominik told me that jugglinglab doesn't support arbitrary hand orderings but
pointed out that I could fake it by translating patterns to sync notation and
padding with 0's where appropriate.

Async to Sync Translation
=========================

There's a pretty easy procedure to take an async pattern and get something
analogous but for two sync hands:

First double all the numbers, then add x's to all the ones that were previously
odd. Now slot those numbers into (0,\_)(\_,0)(0,\_)(\_,0)...

And finally, if the siteswap length is odd, we'll need to slot it in twice, that
way we cover both sides of the pattern.

If you think about what this procedure does - it makes a lot of sense. The
doubling is because sync beats happen half as often. The x's are because you
need to know which hand a ball lands in, and the * is because odd length
siteswaps alternate sides.

So, in a 3-handed world, we can do almost the same procedure.

First we double all numbers in the pattern. Then we suffix them with x's, p's
and xp's to make them land in the correct hand. Then we slot them into
<(\_,0)(0,\_)(0,0)(0,\_)...|(0,0)(0,0)(\_,0)(0,0)>.

And if the pattern length isn't divisible by 4, we slot it in LCM(length, 4)
times to make sure we cover all positions in the cycle.

As I was implementing this, I realized that LMRM is a special case, and I might
as well handle other hand orders as well. This barely changes the procedure! The
only difference is computing which suffix gets applied to which throw, and
computing what string to slot into.

Too Much Empty Space
====================

I sent some demo gifs to Michael, and he said they didn't look how he was
expecting. He pointed out how much time hands were spending empty, and then
showed me some more demo videos of human jugglers doing these patterns.

These two gifs show how my program was rendering siteswap 35, versus how Michael
was imagining it.

Mine:

Michael's:
<img src="/images/3hand/53_2pad.gif" style="max-height: 400px">

In a way, they are both right. My program was making it so a ball would land,
then immediately get thrown. Michael's idea was to have balls land as early as
possible, then wait in the hand until it was time to throw again. This second
way makes more sense for human jugglers because it gives lots of time to correct
mistakes. I decided to add modes for both ways, and also a third mode at an
interesting compromise point in between.

### zero padding

I decided to call my first implementation "zero padding", since it fills empty
time in the pattern with 0s.

### two padding

I decided to call Michael's idea "two padding", since it fills empty time in the
pattern with 2s. I implemented it as an postprocessing step on top of my
zero-padded translator.

Let's go through an example by translating the siteswap 19 (5 ball shower) with
hand order LMRM. The zero-padded translator says this should turn into
<(2x,0)(0,ixp)(0,0)(0,ix)|(0,0)(0,0)(2xp,0)(0,0)> which looks like this:

<img src="/images/3hand/19_0pad.gif" style="max-height: 400px">

But let's focus on the ixp throw. This throw goes up from the middle hand and
lands in the right hand 9 beats later. And what is the right hand doing for
those 9 beats? 

1. 2x
2. 0
3. 0
4. 0
5. 2x
6. 0
7. 0
8. 0
9. catching our ixp and throwing a 2x

So this means we the ix is throw so high that the catching hand has to wait 3
whole beats of 0's for it to land. Instead, let's throw it 3 beats lower and
replace those zeros with 2's (holds). That results in
<(2x,0)(0,**cxp**)(0,0)(0,ix)|(**2**,0)(**2**,0)(2xp,0)(**2**,0)> which looks
like this:

<img src="/images/3hand/19_half_padded.gif" style="max-height: 400px">

The two sides of the pattern show exactly what the modification did. On the
jugglers' right, a balls is held for several beats before getting passed to the
middle. On the jugglers' left, a hand is empty for several beats before catching
and immediately passing to the center.

We can also do this to the ix and end up with symmetric
<(2x,0)(2,cxp)(2,0)(2,cx)|(2,0)(2,0)(2xp,0)(2,0)>.

### light two padding

One thing that I found unsatisfying about two padding was that different 7's in
a siteswap might be thrown to different height. That's because throws to the
outside hands (in hand order LMRM) get lowered more than throws to the middle
hand (which throws twice as frequently). As a result, siteswaps like 744 lost a
lot of character. Here are some gifs of it rendered in both modes:

0 padded:
<img src="/images/3hand/744_0pad.gif" style="max-height: 400px">

2 padded
<img src="/images/3hand/744_2pad.gif" style="max-height: 400px">

To get around this, I added a version of 2 padding with a lighter touch, called
"light two padding". Rather than reducing all throws by the maximum amount, it
reduces all throws by the same amount. This means relative heights are preserved
and all 7's go to the same height (which might or might not be 14). In this
mode, 744 looks like this:

<img src="/images/3hand/744_light2pad.gif" style="max-height: 400px">

I especially like how 744 looks in this mode. It is a nice compromise of
preserving relative heights and avoiding unnecessary empty space.

Multiplex Support
=================

Once I had this working on vanilla siteswaps, a natural extension was to support
multiplex siteswaps. The logic isn't extremely different, but there is quite a
bit of accounting to do when 2 padding a complicated multiplex siteswap. Here
are some gifs to show what's possible:

7b gattoplex in LMR:

7b gattoplex in LMRM:
<img src="/images/3hand/7b_gattoplex_lmrm.gif" style="max-height: 400px">

Remaining Work
==============

I find that a lot of patterns look nicer (especially zero padded ones) when the
bps in jugglinglab is increased. I still haven't figured out how to determine
the right bps though.

The Jugglinglab gif server times out after 30 seconds. That means complicated
patterns, or ones with colors configured sometimes fail to render. You can work
around this using the desktop or android apps but that's not as convenient.

More Animations
===============

I assume most people skimmed the math here and mostly looked at the pictures so
here are some more animations for you:
