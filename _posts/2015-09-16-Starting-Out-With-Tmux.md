title: Starting Out With tmux
---

[tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) is a terminal multiplexer. It allows for near
arbitrary layout of terminals in panes and windows (their words for splits and
tabs) and supports detaching and reattaching terminals. I've been curious
about tmux for a while and finally decided to give it a try a few weeks ago. 

To my dismay, most tmux tutorials were effectively lists of commands with no
explanation of what is critical and what is not.  I am a big fan of [Learn Vim Progressively](http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Learn-Vim-Progressively/)
and think that many other complicated program can benefit from a similarly well
structured guide.
