title: Top of a code block
---

Here is a command that I don't use often but when I use it, I'm glad I have 
access to it.

`[{` - `go to [count] previous unmatched {`

When editing code, I sometimes find myself in the middle of a gigantic code
block and want to know what conditional or loop led me there. This command 
does exactly that. It scans backward for the previous *unmatched* curly brace 
and moves the cursor there.

Example:

~~~ cpp
1.   if (bar < 5) {
2.       baz();
3.   } else if (bar >= 13) {
4.     vector<int> nort = {1,1,2,3,5,8};
--     // 100 lines of C++ code
105.   baz();
106. }
~~~

Lets say my cursor is on line 105 and I can't remember what branch of the 
conditional I'm on. If I input `[{`, the cursor will jump to the open curly brace
on line 20.  It skips the curley braces on line 6 because they match each other. 
It also skips any matched curley braces in the omitted block, regardless of if 
they are on the same line.

I hope you find this useful.
